The C program edge_detection.c is designed to perform edge detection on a grayscale image using the Sobel operator. It specifically processes an input image stored in a raw file format named img.raw, assuming dimensions of 256x256 pixels. This algorithm employs the Sobel operator, consisting of two 3x3 matrices (sobel_x and sobel_y), to compute gradients for identifying edges in the image. By iterating through each pixel (excluding the borders), the program computes horizontal and vertical gradients using the Sobel operator. The gradient magnitude is then determined through the formula sqrt(gx * gx + gy * gy), where gx and gy represent the horizontal and vertical gradients, respectively. The resulting edge-detected image is saved as output_edge.raw, showcasing detected edges based on the calculated gradient magnitudes.# clabpackage
